            <li>
                <p>Form validation has been constantly evolving. You can use preset validatons or make your own</p>
                <p>You can add keywords to the html elements which call specific validation checkers. one such keyword is required which
                    tells the form it cannot submit until the element has been effected.
                </p>
                <p>You should validate before submiting. You should validate when reciving a submition</p>
                <p>there are many psuedo classes in css for styling forms</p>
                <p>The pattern attribute looks both intimidating and useful cuz regular expresions are complex and kinda scary</p>
                <p>When js validating you should be aware of the many preset functions that preform certain validations on call</p>
                <p>there are validation APIs availible</p>
                <p>You can set up a custom error message. Which is a duh. Gonna need a few more looks before I can imitate tho</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I already had the page about fetch bookmarked. Didn't we read it last week, or something?</p>
                <p>a fetch is a promise that uses promise().then().catch()</p>
                <p>I would say you should use indent when dealing with fetch cuz otherwise you might get lost</p>
                <p>Do I fully understand this? No. I have used it before and got it working, but I am still in the "look up
                    every step" spot.
                </p>
