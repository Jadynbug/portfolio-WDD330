        <ol>
            <li><p>
                Should be using let not var. Gotta remember that.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Try to declare what a variable is so that you avoid the mess of coersion.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                unshift adds to the front of an array.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Not 100% sure what the "..." means. It seems to flatten things?
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                If you want to do stuff with $ in a string you gotta use the back-ticks. The little thing on the key with the tilda `
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Remember that default arguments are a thing:
            </p><p>
                Function hello(name="world") {}
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Arrow functions are not something I've used
            </p><p>
                const square = x => x*x; == function square(x) {x*x}; <br>
                const add = (x,y) => x+y; == function add(x,y) {x+y}; <br>
                const hello = () => alert("Hello World!"); == function hello() {alert("Hello World")};
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Arrow functions must be called as funcitons. Obviously. It deffinately didn't take me several
                hours and help to relized this. I found it imediatly logical. How dare you question me.
