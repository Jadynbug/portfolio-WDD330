                Did you know you can put more than one animation on an element by use of the comma? 
                Why didn't any of the reading and whatever else say that? HUH??? Why did I have to spend most of last 
                week failing to google it only to find in an example on a blogpost about cool animation examples?<br> ARRRRRRRRRRRRRG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
