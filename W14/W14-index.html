                    I have learned a lot this semester. Did I get all the things working? No. Some of that was me
                    trying to do things a different way and thinking I'd get back to it but not having enough time, 
                    and the rest was I couldn't figure out how to fix the instructor code.

                    I am so much more comfortable and confident with my JS and if I don't know how to do something? I've 
                    found excellent resources to turn to.

                <p>While I plan to justify my scores in the video, I also plan to put some of it here. If only for planning purposes</p>

                <h3>Efficentcy / curiosity / Creativity</h3>
                <p>
                    I have found, looking through my code as the semester has gone by, that it is much more 
                    concise and that I've found good ways to get things done quickly and easily. My code is easier to read and,
                    as far as I can tell, is running faster and more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have had a lot of fun trying and learning new things this semester. I've done things with code that I hadn't
                    considered, and have learned to look at it in a new way. I've had so much fun testing, trying, and researching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've learned tips and tricks through the semester that have shown in my code. I've found better ways to do things
                    and found it fun to look at things from different angles.

                <h3>Resources</h3>
                <p>
                    I have ended up doing a lot of researching this semester. I have a list of sites that I found to be generally
                    helpful with most problems I run into. My top three would be StackOverflow, W3School, and GeeksforGeeks.

                <h3>Helping / Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    I have attended every team activity, most lasting 2+ hours, and been an active participant the entire time.
                    The team activities have been interesting learning experiences. Partly because it was new, we had to do research,
                    and work together, and partly becuase most of the time the instructor code did not work. Which made it hard to learn
                    from it. Point being, I had a lot of fun working with my team every week. Not all of my team activity code works, but that
                    is due to trying and failing to either follow along with faulty instructor code or trying to do it a different way. In any 
                    case, at least one of us always hit each on the core requirements and at least one stretch goal.

                <h3>Breaking it Down</h3>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot about breaking down a project into workable chuncks. The Trello cards were very helpful for that.
                    I don't think I've mastered it, mostly due to not always getting how to space out smaller goals by how long they take or
                    how hard they will be. I feel like I've got it close to down, but that it is still a work in progress. I'm pleased with 
                    how I managed to break down and finish my challenge two project in time even with losing a week to researching a error.

                <h3>Troubleshooting / Bug Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    I would like to think I've gotten better at this. I'll admit that while I still not fully comfortable with coding error
                    handling first, I've gotten the habbit of drowning my code in console.log()s so I know where the error is happening. 
                    I've also gotten a lot better with CSS errors in my other class. I had a team member who would copy paste code without 
                    checking his curly brackets. I've gotten quick at finding bracket errors any fixing them. 
                </p>

                <h3>Developing / Debugging</h3>
                <p>Most of my debugging "proof" is above, so I'll focus on developing here. I've gotten much more comfortable with dev
                    tools. I'm now able to easily locate errors to fix in code before rerunning, or to test in dev tools before tranfering
                    and saving the new code. I've learned a lot about getting a proper meshing of HTML, JS, and CSS to set up a good site. My 
                    animation skills, event listener setting, and code arranging has gotten so much better.

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    I've learned so much this semester. I can see the difference in my code and the little sites I've made. I'm proud of 
                    my progress, and am excited to keep learning more. Thanx :)
