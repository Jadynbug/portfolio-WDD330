        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Working git is surprisingly complicated and annoying. It will definately take practice.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I will need to make this actually look good later. I have ideas and I think I've thought ahead by adding
                    a template for later weeks html pages. :)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>I have gotten a lot more familiar with git and merging. I had a lot of trouble getting the links to work right,
                but I seem to have managed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It is better to use .. to reference a file in a folder above. Took a while to figure that one out, but 
                    it fixed several issues.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>As a mainly phone user I can say that if I go to a website and find it to be awful on my phone I leave either
                    imediately or alomost imediately.
